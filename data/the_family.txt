Do you like what I’ve done with the place, Bats? Something seems… off, doesn’t it? Or maybe it’s just me. Ha! This is my masterpiece, you see. I finally tore it all off. My face. It’s just skin, after all, a mask. A joke. Just like you! You wear your mask, and I wear mine, but mine... mine is real now. Isn’t it beautiful? I’ve never felt so free!
