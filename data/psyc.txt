Arthur:  
You don’t listen, do you? I don’t think you ever really listen. You just ask the same questions every week. "How's your job?" "Are you having any negative thoughts?" All I have are negative thoughts.

Social Worker:  
Arthur, I’m sorry, but they’ve cut our funding. We’re closing down our office. You won’t have anyone to talk to.

Arthur:  
What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to get my medication now? How am I supposed to...?

Social Worker:  
I’m sorry, Arthur. There’s nothing more I can do.

Arthur:  
They don’t give a s*** about people like you, and they don’t give a s*** about people like me either.

Arthur:  
You know what? I’ve been feeling really good lately. I stopped taking my medication. I feel so much better now.

Social Worker:  
Arthur, that’s not how it works. You can’t just stop your medication...

Arthur:  
What do you care? You don’t listen. You ask the same questions every week, but you never listen.
